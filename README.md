# To-Do-list-app-v2
An upgraded version of my last To Do list app with MongoDB database

# What to expect
An upgraded ToDo list app wherein you can add tasks by pressing the **Add** button and checking the **checkbox** to delete an item from the list. You can also make multiple lists by adding a parameter on your URL.

**Examples:** `localhost:3000/Work` > *returns Work list*
`localhost:3000/home` > *returns Home list*
`localhost:3000/ShoPping` > *returns Shopping list*

Take note that it is also not case sensitive as I use **lodash** for that functionality.

# How to use
First install all the packages and modules by typing `npm i` or `npm install` on your terminal. 
- type `mongod` on one shell to make a database using MongoDB
- initialize your app by typing `node index.js`
- type in the URL: localhost:3000 to start making your own lists

# Tools used
EJS, CSS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB, Mongoose
